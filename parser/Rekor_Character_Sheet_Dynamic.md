> You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.
> This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

>
> When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.

> You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
>
> - **Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.  
> - **Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

> One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it.

>
> If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.
>

> You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
>
> The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.
>
> To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the [Study](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Study) action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence ([Investigation](/z_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC.

> You cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object’s perceived value by adding illusory flourishes or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory scratches, dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can ascertain its true value with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

> casting_time: 1 Hour
> range: 10 feet
> components: V, S, M (burning incense worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: [Bat](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/bat-xmm.md), [Cat](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/cat-xmm.md), [Frog](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/frog-xmm.md), [Hawk](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hawk-xmm.md), [Lizard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/lizard-xmm.md), [Octopus](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/octopus-xmm.md), [Owl](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/owl-xmm.md), [Rat](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rat-xmm.md), [Raven](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/raven-xmm.md), [Spider](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/spider-xmm.md), [Weasel](/z_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/weasel-xmm.md), or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
>
> ##### Telepathic Connection
>
> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a [Bonus Action](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
>
> Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a [Reaction](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.
>
> ##### Combat
>
> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own [Initiative](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
>
> ##### Disappearance of the Familiar

You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine. The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly. Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook. Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook. Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
