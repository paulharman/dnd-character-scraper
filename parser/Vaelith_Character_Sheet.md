### Spell Details
#### Message
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Transmutation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 0 feet
> components: S, M (a copper wire)
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
>
> You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
>

<BR>

#### Minor Illusion
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Illusion
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
> duration: 1 minute
> ```
>
> You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.
>
> If a creature takes a [Study](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Study) action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/z_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
>
> ##### Sound
>
> If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
>
> ##### Image
>
> If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.
>

<BR>

#### Prestidigitation
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Transmutation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 10 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You create a magical effect within range. Choose the effect from the options below. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.
>
> ##### Sensory Effect
>
> You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
>
> ##### Fire Play
>
> You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
>
> ##### Clean or Soil
>
> You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
>
> ##### Minor Sensation
>
> You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
>
> ##### Magic Mark
>
> You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
>
> ##### Minor Creation
>
> You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand. It lasts until the end of your next turn. A trinket can deal no damage and has no monetary worth.
>

<BR>

#### Sorcerous Burst
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 0 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d8` damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.
>
> If you roll an 8 on a `d8` for this spell, you can roll another `d8`, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.
>
> **Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
>

<BR>

#### True Strike
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Divination
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: S, M (a weapon with which you have proficiency and that is worth 1+ CP)
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> Guided by a flash of magical insight, you make one attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting. The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).
>
> **Cantrip Upgrade.** Whether you deal Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage type, the attack deals extra Radiant damage when you reach levels 5 (`1d6`), 11 (`2d6`), and 17 (`3d6`).
>

<BR>

#### Chromatic Orb
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `3d8` damage of the chosen type.
>
> If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
>

<BR>

#### False Life
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 0 feet
> components: V, S, M (a drop of alcohol)
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You gain `2d4 + 4` [Temporary Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You gain 5 additional [Temporary Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) for each spell slot level above 1.

>
> Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table. Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

## Background

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Noble
>
> You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
>
> Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.
>
> Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?
>
> What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
>
> Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?
>
> These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.
>
> **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
>
> **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
>
> **Languages:** One of your choice
>
> **Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp
>
> Feature: Position of Privelege
>
> Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
>
> Variant Noble: Knight
>
> A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).
>
> As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart—in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.) Variant Feature: Retainers If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.
>
> You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused
>
>### Personal Possessions
>
> Item: Vaelith’s Silver Nail File
Type: Personal Item
Weight: Negligible

Description:
A sleek, finely-crafted silver nail file — polished to a mirror sheen and engraved along the handle with the subtle, curling sigil of House Duskthorn. Embedded at the base of the handle sits a flawless 1-carat diamond, catching the light with cold, perfect clarity. The file was a gift from her mother — once a simple token of elegance, now the last thread that binds her to a family that cast her aside.

Though designed for the meticulous care of her long, black-painted nails, the file’s pointed tip has been discreetly sharpened beyond mere vanity. More than an accessory, it serves as both a quiet weapon and a symbol: her family shaped her into something elegant, sharp and dangerous.
a scroll of pedigree
>
>### Organizations
>
> House Duskthorn (Former Affiliation)
— The highborn elven family she was born into.
— Cold, political, and image-obsessed, they value reputation over truth.
— After the betrayal and their refusal to believe her, she abandoned them. Some of them might still watch her from the shadows, either out of guilt… or to protect their name.
>
>### Allies & Contacts
>
> Eryndor Veylin (Old Tutor)
> — A stern but kind-hearted elven mage who taught her the basics of control before her power truly awakened.
> — The only person from her old life she still has any fondness for — though she’d never admit it.
>
>### Enemies
>
> Lord Thalen Rhyvaris (The Betrayer)
— The man who wronged her. Charming, calculating, and utterly self-serving. He lied and turned her family against her when she needed them most.
— Highborn, politically protected, still out there. Their unfinished business is the quiet storm behind her sharpness.
>
>### Ideals
>
> Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself!
>
>### Bonds
>
> I will never let betrayal go unpunished
>
>### Flaws
>
> Heart hidden by sharp tongue and cold stare.
>
>### Personality Traits
>
> I never show weakness — better they fear me than pity me. If you earn my loyalty, I will burn the world for you — but don’t expect me to say it out loud.

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> Born into the ancient and unyielding House Duskthorn, Vaelith grew up wrapped in silks, duty, and suffocating expectation. Her family prized status and image above all else, molding her into the perfect noble daughter — obedient, elegant, and silent. But fate had other plans.
>
> When her innate sorcerous power first sparked, it was seen as an asset, a rare gift to parade at court — until the day she uncovered a betrayal so deep it shattered the world she knew. A nobleman she once trusted, a man who had charmed his way past her walls, wronged her in the worst way, only to twist the truth before her family could ever hold him accountable. His lies were silver-tongued, his reputation untouchable — and House Duskthorn, ever loyal to their image above all, branded her a liar.
>
> The wound cut deeper than any blade. Cast out by the only people who should have stood at her side, Vaelith left with nothing but a handful of stolen coin, her sharpened will, her growing command over lightning, and an iron vow to carve her own name into history — on her terms, not theirs.
>
> The last of her gold bought her a place aboard a nameless ship, its sails fat with wind and bound for the forgotten edges of the world. For now, she needs coin to survive. But her true hunger is for power — enough to command the respect her family denied her, enough to make the world swallow every bitter word they ever dared speak against her.
>
> She walks the world with a storm behind her eyes and a resting expression cold enough to kill. Her nails — long, sharp, and meticulously painted black — are as much a weapon as her magic, and she wears them like a queen wears a crown: a quiet, permanent reminder that she doesn’t need steel to draw blood.
>
> To the world, she is cold, calculating, and unapproachable. But beneath the sharp edges lies a heart that still burns — for freedom, for justice, and for the protection of those few souls worthy of her trust.
>
> Wrong her, and you’ll regret it. Betray her, and you’ll wish she’d chosen lightning. And should the man who shattered her life cross her path again… death would be too kind a fate.
