    "backstory": "From the carefree youth of sun-kissed fields, farmer’s son Baldrin Highfoot grew into an affable and kindly young hobbit. He was in no way considered exceptional, although his nimble fingers and curious mind seemed, perhaps, uncommon.  Indeed, his days might have unfolded in quiet village life, had fate not sent a wandering minstrel to his isolated village.\n\nBeneath a twilight sky, the bard spun gossamer melodies, weaving through the villagers like a gentle breeze. And although he sang not a word, the no-nonsense farmers found themselves smiling, laughing, and at times even wiping a tear with thick loamy fingers, as the musician’s hands skipped over the fretboard like jumping fleas.\n \nAs the evening drew to a close, and the dazed villagers drifted back to their Hobbit holes, only Baldrin remained, speechless and bemused.\n\nRecognising a kindred spirit, the kindly musician gifted Baldrin a final ballad, an ancient song laced with a deeper enchantment. He sang of ancient dragons, of cunning Goblins and creatures trapped between life and death. He sang of treasure and adventure and fellowship.  One moment, the kindly eyes of the musician twinkled in the firelight, and the next, only the scent of wildflowers on the wind remained.  And as the final notes faded, a longing for something beyond familiar tugged at Baldrin’s heart, a feeling as new and surprising as the silver flute now resting on his lap.\n\nAnd in that twilight moment, the ordinary life of Baldrin Highfoot played the first tentative notes of a new and extraordinary melody.\n\n\n\n\n",
