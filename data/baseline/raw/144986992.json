Embedded at the base of the handle sits a flawless 1-carat diamond, catching the light with cold, perfect clarity. The file was a gift from her mother — once a simple token of elegance, now the last thread that binds her to a family that cast her aside.\n\nThough designed for the meticulous care of her long, black-painted nails, the file’s pointed tip has been discreetly sharpened beyond mere vanity. More than an accessory, it serves as both a quiet weapon and a symbol: her family shaped her into something elegant, sharp and dangerous.\na scroll of pedigree","otherHoldings":null,"organizations":"House Duskthorn (Former Affiliation)\n— The highborn elven family she was born into.\n— Cold, political, and image-obsessed, they value reputation over truth.\n— After the betrayal and their refusal to believe her, she abandoned them.

Her family prized status and image above all else, molding her into the perfect noble daughter — obedient, elegant, and silent. But fate had other plans.\n\nWhen her innate sorcerous power first sparked, it was seen as an asset, a rare gift to parade at court — until the day she uncovered a betrayal so deep it shattered the world she knew. A nobleman she once trusted, a man who had charmed his way past her walls, wronged her in the worst way, only to twist the truth before her family could ever hold him accountable. His lies were silver-tongued, his reputation untouchable — and House Duskthorn, ever loyal to their image above all, branded her a liar.\n\nThe wound cut deeper than any blade. Cast out by the only people who should have stood at her side, Vaelith left with nothing but a handful of stolen coin, her sharpened will, her growing command over lightning, and an iron vow to carve her own name into history — on her terms, not theirs.\n\nThe last of her gold bought her a place aboard a nameless ship, its sails fat with wind and bound for the forgotten edges of the world. For now, she needs coin to survive. But her true hunger is for power — enough to command the respect her family denied her, enough to make the world swallow every bitter word they ever dared speak against her.\n\nShe walks the world with a storm behind her eyes and a resting expression cold enough to kill. Her nails — long, sharp, and meticulously painted black — are as much a weapon as her magic, and she wears them like a queen wears a crown: a quiet, permanent reminder that she doesn’t need steel to draw blood.\n\nTo the world, she is cold, calculating, and unapproachable. But beneath the sharp edges lies a heart that still burns — for freedom, for justice, and for the protection of those few souls worthy of her trust.\n\nWrong her, and you’ll regret it. Betray her, and you’ll wish she’d chosen lightning. And should the man who shattered her life cross her path again… death would be too kind a fate.","otherNotes":"“Some say her nails are sharper than any dagger, but it’s her stare you’ve got to worry about.”"},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"I never show weakness — better they fear me than pity me.
