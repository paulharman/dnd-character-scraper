Its eyes, literal gemstones set securely in their sockets. Its metallic form was engraved finely with gold inlay, work of a true master craftsman. \n\nIts body was lined with interlocking plates of metal, coming together to shield it like a fine suit of armor. Around its shoulders a cloak was wrapped, made of crimson threads with cerulean and gold stitching. The brooch bore the all seeing eye of Helm, god of protection. \n\nUnderneath the cloak it wore a saffron tabard, with a crimson streak through it. At its waist was a belt of various smith's tools, and a large arcane tome.\n\nYears ago Redgrave used to try and conceal its appearance under extra layers of armor and a helmet. Now it cares not so much for the suspicions of mortal men. While many look at it with confusion, disgust, or even fear; it would never blame them.\n\nOn the other hand, news of its exploits and craftsmanship have earned it a bit of a reputation. Many townsfolk have taken to calling it the Clockwork Cleric. A name that would make it roll its eyes if it could actually do such a thing. \n",

    "name": "Guild Artisan / Guild Merchant",
    "description": "You are a member of an artisan’s guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right. **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan’s tools **Languages:** One of your choice **Equipment:** A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Guild Business Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly. d20 Guild Business 1 Alchemists and apothecaries 2 Armorers, locksmiths, and finesmiths 3 Brewers, distillers, and vintners 4 Calligraphers, scribes, and scriveners 5 Carpenters, roofers, and plasterers 6 Cartographers, surveyors, and chart-makers 7 Cobblers and shoemakers 8 Cooks and bakers 9 Glassblowers and glaziers 10 Jewelers and gemcutters 11 Leatherworkers, skinners, and tanners 12 Masons and stonecutters 13 Painters, limners, and sign-makers 14 Potters and tile-makers 15 Shipwrights and sailmakers 16 Smiths and metal-forgers 17 Tinkers, pewterers, and casters 18 Wagon-makers and wheelwrights 19 Weavers and dyers 20 Woodcarvers, coopers, and bowyers As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together. Feature: Guild Membership As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Merchant Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.",

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. **Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. **Part Water.** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. **Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. **Whirlpool.** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.",

    "backstory": "Forged in lightning and blood by the dark wizard Eludrax, \"Eight\" was born. The wizard's thirst for eternal life led him not to the cultivation of a new fleshy body, but a perfect one of his own design.\nUsing ancient techniques from lands quite distant, Eludrax forged machines for his allies war efforts. Nothing, however, could keep him from his true life's work.\n\n---\n\nIt was the eighth of Eludrax's shield guardians, and thus aptly named. \n\nMost of of the Lich's constructs bore no soul of their own, merely mindless automatons for his own bidding. He would often pluck lost souls from Limbo and twist and torture them to suit his machinations. \n\nBut the eight were different. They were his personal bodyguards, improved physically in every way, and candidates for his transference of life. Most importantly, they were devoid of soul.\n\nAt the aging dark wizard's command the constructs committed unspeakable atrocities. They were the harbingers of his dirty work, and Eludrax was not above committing horrors in the name of his research.\n\nEight was his magnum opus, and thus his intended vessel. His plan to transfer his own soul into the guardian was made haste, however, as Eludrax awoke one night to an adventurer's group tearing through his laboratory. He commanded Eight to follow, sending the other seven to combat the coming threat. \n\nHe clamored as fast as he could to the dark crystal machine intended to bind his soul into his vessel,  and spilled his blood on the dais with a quick slice to the palm. He grasped Eight's cool metal hand, and forced it onto the crystal. Thus, the dark ritual began. Eludrax's eyes went white as his spirit was ripped from his body and absorbed into the orb. \n\nWhat he miscalculated, however, was that a soul already existed inside his creation. It was faint, beaten down by years of cruelty and transgression, but there nonetheless.\n\nThe Lich's powerful spirit growled menacingly as it reached out to pluck the soul from Eight. Before he could, however, a burst of radiance appeared to encapsulate the soul. Eludrax's fury burned hot, but was not strong enough to pierce the veil of light. \n\nTime was not on the dark wizard's side. The party that'd breached his laboratory had finally made it into this sanctum. The group exchanged quick words, deliberating on their plan of action. Before their sorcerer could cry out, however, the paladin raised her mace and brought it crashing down on the large swirling crystal. As it shattered, the wizard's soul was cast into limbo, spiraling out of the material plane with a guttural scream.\n\n\"Am I...?\" Eight spoke aloud with a sound of relief, before collapsing to the cold stone floor with a hearty thud. \n\n---\n\nEight awoke to the stench of burning and the feel of a warm hand against its cold metal chest. In the distance the tower it'd known as its home, the place of its creation, was fervently ablaze.\n\n\"Can it understand us?\" One of the adventurers pondered out loud. \nEight nodded in response \n\nThe woman whose hand was pulsating over it with life magic leaned in a bit closer to its face.\n\"So, do you have a name?\" She asked in a soft voice, curiously, as if she were talking to a child.\n\nEight looked down at the ground, then back at the burning spire behind him. \n\n\"Redgrave,\" it muttered quietly, then returned its gaze to hers. \n\n\"My name is Redgrave.\"\n\n\"Like that tower?\" One of the men in the group asked questioningly. \n\n\"Yes,\" the forged known formerly as Eight responded.\n\"So that I may never forget what happened here.\" \n",
