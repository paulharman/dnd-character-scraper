>
> ```spell-components

> range: 120 feet
> components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

#### Faerie Fire

>
> ```spell-components

> range: 60 feet
> components: V
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

#### Darkness

>
> ```spell-components

> range: 60 feet
> components: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don’t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> I was never meant for the underdark, but then Drow really arent' welcome anywhere else. The Lolth-sworn of my kind are weak minded, following mommy dearest like lambs to slaughter. As a child I was always a free thinker and a free spirit. I'd rather explore and make friends than fight to prove my worth. I asked "why" too much, I could never blindly obey. It would have gotten me killed if I didn't find out just how dangerous I was to Lolth's agenda. 
> While others of my kind would kill each other for station and ambition, I dreamt of a life beyond the confines of darkness; a life full of love, acceptance, and kindness. Of course I wouldn't have known what any of that was if my sister hadn't shown me. In secret, we made a little pact of our own. She confided in me that Drow have left the underdark before, so we decided that we would flee together after I had trained. It took years for us to find a way out and plan our escape. We lived a double life of appeasing Lolth while also gaining access to our historic records and the best trainers so I could learn and prepare. Enduring that was a special kind of hell.
> During that time I honed my skills in stealth, deception, and sleight of hand. My sister breathed compassion into me for the lambs who got in so deep that they lost any sense of self. "Their free will was twisted and carved into weapons for Lolth," my sister would say to me. 
> We were mere weeks away from enacting our escape plan before my sister was discovered. She was murdered and made an example of. She gave me an amulet just the day before which displayed a crescent moon within a circle. She told me this stone is the color of the sky beyond the underdark. "Look to the sky and you'll find your way," were her last words to me. 
> I had no idea how she got the stone or what it meant at the time, but in hindsight, she knew that the plan we made together was a journey I would be walking alone. Since then I have never taken it off. My purpose is clear: release as many people as possible from the clutches of tyranny and oppression.
