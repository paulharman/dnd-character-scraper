### Spell Details
#### Mage Hand
>
> ```badges
> items:

>   - label: Conjuration
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 minute
> ```
>
> A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
>
> When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.
>
> As a [Magic](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action on your later turns, you can control the hand thus again. As part of that action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet.
>
> The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

<BR>

#### Minor Illusion
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Illusion
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
> duration: 1 minute
> ```
>
> You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.
>
> If a creature takes a [Study](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Study) action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/z_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
>
>##### Sound
>
> If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
>
>##### Image
>
> If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

#### Charm Person
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Enchantment
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [Charmed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [Charmed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

<BR>

#### Command
>
> ```badges

>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 60 feet
> components: V
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:
>
> - **Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.  
> - **Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.  
> - **Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.  
> - **Grovel.** The target has the [Prone](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition and then ends its turn.  
> - **Halt.** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or [Bonus Action](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).  
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

<BR>

#### Cure Wounds
>

>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Special
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> A creature you touch regains a number of [Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `2d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 1.

<BR>

#### Disguise Self

>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Special
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
>
> The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.
>
> To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the [Study](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Study) action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence ([Investigation](/z_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC.

<BR>

#### Healing Word
>

>
> ```spell-components

>
> A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains [Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `2d4` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
>
> **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `2d4` for each spell slot level above 1.

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> From the carefree youth of sun-kissed fields, farmer’s son Baldrin Highfoot grew into an affable and kindly young hobbit. He was in no way considered exceptional, although his nimble fingers and curious mind seemed, perhaps, uncommon.  Indeed, his days might have unfolded in quiet village life, had fate not sent a wandering minstrel to his isolated village.
>
> Beneath a twilight sky, the bard spun gossamer melodies, weaving through the villagers like a gentle breeze. And although he sang not a word, the no-nonsense farmers found themselves smiling, laughing, and at times even wiping a tear with thick loamy fingers, as the musician’s hands skipped over the fretboard like jumping fleas.
>
> As the evening drew to a close, and the dazed villagers drifted back to their Hobbit holes, only Baldrin remained, speechless and bemused.
>
> Recognising a kindred spirit, the kindly musician gifted Baldrin a final ballad, an ancient song laced with a deeper enchantment. He sang of ancient dragons, of cunning Goblins and creatures trapped between life and death. He sang of treasure and adventure and fellowship.  One moment, the kindly eyes of the musician twinkled in the firelight, and the next, only the scent of wildflowers on the wind remained.  And as the final notes faded, a longing for something beyond familiar tugged at Baldrin’s heart, a feeling as new and surprising as the silver flute now resting on his lap.
>
> And in that twilight moment, the ordinary life of Baldrin Highfoot played the first tentative notes of a new and extraordinary melody.
