> You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

#### Light

>
> ```spell-components

> components: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

<BR>

#### Sacred Flame
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components

> range: 60 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw. The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

<BR>

#### Toll the Dead
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components

> ```
>
> You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage. The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

<BR>

#### Bless
>
> ```badges

>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

<BR>

#### Cure Wounds
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components

>
> A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

<BR>

#### Detect Magic
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Divination
>   - label: Ritual
>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Special
> components: V, S
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

<BR>

#### Disguise Self
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Illusion
>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Special
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person--look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

<BR>

#### Guiding Bolt
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 120 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 round
> ```
>
> A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

<BR>

#### Hold Person
>
> ```badges

>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 60 feet
> components: V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)
> duration: Concentration
> ```
>
> Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

<BR>

#### Lesser Restoration
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components

>
> You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

<BR>

#### Prayer of Healing

>
> Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. **At Higher Levels. **When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

<BR>

#### Spiritual Weapon
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 2
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Reaction
> range: 60 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 minute
> ```
>
> You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon. ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

<BR>

#### Zone of Truth
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 2
>   - label: Enchantment
>   - label:
>   - label: A
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 60 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: 10 minutes
> ```
>
> You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

<BR>

#### Aura of Vitality
>

>

>
> Healing energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. You can use a bonus action to cause one creature in the aura (including you) to regain 2d6 hit points.

<BR>

#### Dispel Magic
>

>
> ```spell-components

> ```
>
> Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

> As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. **At Higher Levels. **When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. **At Higher Levels. **When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Features

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### War Caster (Feat)
>
> You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits: • You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage. • You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands. • When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.
>
> The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.
>
