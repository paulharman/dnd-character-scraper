> You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

## Background

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Hermit
>
> <p>You lived in seclusion&mdash;either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone&mdash;for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Medicine, Religion</p>
<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Herbalism kit</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, an herbalism kit, and 5 gp</p>
<hr />
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Life of Seclusion</h5>
<p>What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.</p>
<table class="compendium-left-aligned-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>d8</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Life of Seclusion</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>I was searching for spiritual enlightenment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>I was exiled for a crime I didn’t commit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>I retreated from society after a life-altering event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>I needed to commune with nature, far from civilization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Feature: Discovery</h5>
<p>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p>
<p>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.</p>
<hr />
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Other Hermits</h5>
<p>This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/outlander">outlander</a> background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/acolyte">acolyte</a> might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/charlatan">charlatan</a>, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.</p>
