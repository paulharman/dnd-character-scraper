You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed [Dim Light](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [Invisible](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

> - **Casting time:** 1 Action - **Range:** 60 feet - **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal) - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes For the duration, magical [Darkness](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [Darkvision](/z_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

## Racial Traits

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Elf Traits
>
>#### Keen Senses
>
> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
>
>#### Fey Ancestry
>
> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
>
>#### Trance
>
> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Ability Score Increase
>
> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
>
>#### Languages
>
> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
>
>#### Age
>
> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
>
>#### Superior Darkvision
>
> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.
>
> *Range: 120 feet*
>
>#### Sunlight Sensitivity
>
> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
>
>#### Drow Magic
>
> You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
>
>#### Drow Weapon Training
>
> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.
>
>#### Ability Score Increase
>
> Your Charisma score increases by 1.

## Background

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Outlander
>
> <p>You grew up in the wilds, far from the comforts of town and technology. You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don’t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Survival</p>
<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of musical instrument</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A staff, a hunting trap, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p>
<hr />
<h5 class="compendium-hr">Origin</h5>
<p>You’ve been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character.</p>
<table class="compendium-left-aligned-table">

<h5 class="compendium-hr">Feature: Wanderer</h5>
<p>You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.</p>

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> I was never meant for the underdark, but then Drow really arent' welcome anywhere else. The Lolth-sworn of my kind are weak minded, following mommy dearest like lambs to slaughter. As a child I was always a free thinker and a free spirit. I'd rather explore and make friends than fight to prove my worth. I asked "why" too much, I could never blindly obey. It would have gotten me killed if I didn't find out just how dangerous I was to Lolth's agenda. 
While others of my kind would kill each other for station and ambition, I dreamt of a life beyond the confines of darkness; a life full of love, acceptance, and kindness. Of course I wouldn't have known what any of that was if my sister hadn't shown me. In secret, we made a little pact of our own. She confided in me that Drow have left the underdark before, so we decided that we would flee together after I had trained. It took years for us to find a way out and plan our escape. We lived a double life of appeasing Lolth while also gaining access to our historic records and the best trainers so I could learn and prepare. Enduring that was a special kind of hell.
During that time I honed my skills in stealth, deception, and sleight of hand. My sister breathed compassion into me for the lambs who got in so deep that they lost any sense of self. "Their free will was twisted and carved into weapons for Lolth," my sister would say to me. 
We were mere weeks away from enacting our escape plan before my sister was discovered. She was murdered and made an example of. She gave me an amulet just the day before which displayed a crescent moon within a circle. She told me this stone is the color of the sky beyond the underdark. "Look to the sky and you'll find your way," were her last words to me. 
I had no idea how she got the stone or what it meant at the time, but in hindsight, she knew that the plan we made together was a journey I would be walking alone. Since then I have never taken it off. My purpose is clear: release as many people as possible from the clutches of tyranny and oppression.
