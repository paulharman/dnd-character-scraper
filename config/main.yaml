# GLOBAL PATHS
# ===================================================================
# All paths are relative to the project root directory
# These paths are used throughout the application for data storage and processing
paths:
  character_data: "character_data"             # Primary storage for character JSON files and snapshots
  spells_folder: "obsidian/spells"             # Enhanced spell descriptions for markdown generation

# GLOBAL LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# Controls application-wide logging behavior
# Environment-specific overrides are defined in the environments section below
logging:
  level: "INFO"                                # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  # Note: Additional logging settings (file output, formatting) are handled
  # in environment-specific configurations to avoid cluttering the main config

# ===================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES
# ===================================================================
# These settings override the defaults above based on the current environment
# The active environment is determined by the 'environment' setting above
environments:
  # Development environment - for local development and debugging
  development:
    debug: true                                # Enable debug mode for detailed error information
    logging:
      level: "DEBUG"                           # Verbose logging for development troubleshooting
  
  # Testing environment - for automated testing and CI/CD
  testing:
    logging:
      level: "WARNING"                         # Reduced logging to focus on issues during testing
  
  # Production environment - for live deployment
  production:
    debug: false                               # Disable debug mode for security and performance
    logging:
      level: "INFO"                            # Standard logging level for production monitoring
