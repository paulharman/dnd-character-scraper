  # ===================================================================
  # ITEM CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM
  # ===================================================================
  # The parser automatically categorizes inventory items into groups like
  # weapons, armor, tools, documents, etc. These overrides allow fine-tuning
  # the categorization for edge cases and specific item types.
  categorization:
    # ===================================================================
    # DOCUMENT PATTERNS
    # ===================================================================
    # Items matching these patterns will be categorized as "Documents"
    # Patterns are case-insensitive and match anywhere in the item name
    # Used for: books, maps, scrolls, letters, and other written materials
    document_patterns:
      - "book -"          # Matches "Book - Title" format
      - "book:"           # Matches "Book: Title" format
      - "book "           # Matches "Book Title" format
      - "spellbook"       # Any spellbook variant
      - "map -"           # Matches "Map - Location" format
      - "map:"            # Matches "Map: Location" format
      - "map "            # Matches "Map Location" format
      - "scroll -"        # Matches "Scroll - Type" format
      - "scroll:"         # Matches "Scroll: Type" format
      - "scroll "         # Matches "Scroll Type" format
    
    # ===================================================================
    # VALUABLE MATERIALS
    # ===================================================================
    # Items containing these materials will be categorized as "Valuables"
    # Used for: precious metals, gems, and other inherently valuable materials
    # These override the default categorization to ensure valuable items
    # are properly grouped for easy identification
    valuable_materials:
      - "silver"          # Silver items (coins, jewelry, utensils)
      - "gold"            # Gold items (coins, jewelry, decorations)

      - "pewter"          # Pewter items (tableware, decorations)
    
    # ===================================================================
    # VALUABLE TABLEWARE
    # ===================================================================
    # Tableware items that should be categorized as "Valuables" when made
    # from precious materials. This works in combination with valuable_materials
    # to catch items like "Silver Goblet" or "Gold Plate"
    valuable_tableware:
      - "bowl"            # Bowls (eating, serving, decorative)
      - "cup"             # Cups and drinking vessels
      - "mug"             # Mugs and tankards
