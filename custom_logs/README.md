# Custom Logs Directory

This directory contains runtime logs generated by the D&D character scraper system.

## Contents

- `error_log.json` - Application error logs and debugging information
- Other log files generated during runtime

## Note

Log files are automatically created by the application and contain runtime data. These files are excluded from git commits to protect personal information and prevent log file pollution in the repository.

The application will create necessary log files when they don't exist.
