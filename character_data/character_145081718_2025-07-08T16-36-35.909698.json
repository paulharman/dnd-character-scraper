      "description": "<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.</p>\r\n<p>When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spellbook.</em></strong> Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book\u2019s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.</p>\r\n<p>The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</em></strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.</p>\r\n<p>If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</em></strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.</p>\r\n<aside id=\"ExpandingandReplacingaSpellbook\" class=\"text--rules-sidebar\" style=\"--sb-rules-sidebar: #e9dacb; --dark-sb-rules-sidebar: #4f4133;\">\r\n<p>Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook</p>\r\n<p>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book.</em></strong> When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it\u2019s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Copying the Book.</em></strong> You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.</p>\r\n</aside>",

Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dousing a Space.</em></strong> You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Fuel.</em></strong> Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn\u2019t need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a Utilize action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours.</p>",

    "allies": "Professor Virel Thand \u2013 One of the few instructors Ilarion admired. Virel encouraged independent thinking and left him with the Clockwork Cipher, a parting gift and challenge. Their relationship was based on mutual respect rather than sentiment.",
    "backstory": "From a young age, Ilarion was always a step ahead. Born into a lesser noble house in the city of Elarith, he grew up in a world where knowledge meant status. But where others saw learning as tradition, he saw it as conquest. From the start, he wasn't satisfied with understanding what was known - he was driven to uncover what was not.\n\nAt the Arcanum Lyceum, Ilarion quickly made a name for himself, not just for his exceptional intellect, but for his relentless pursuit of knowledge at any cost. His brilliance was undeniable, though it often came paired with an arrogance that grated on his peers and instructors alike. He wasn\u2019t content to simply learn what was presented to him - he questioned everything, disregarded traditional methods, and constantly pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable study.\n\nIlarion often ignored the advice of his professors, seeking answers to questions that had yet to be posed in the curriculum. He\u2019d sneak into the restricted archives, eager to dig through forbidden texts, and propose his own untested theories during lectures, frustrating those around him. He wasn\u2019t interested in what others thought was practical or safe; he wanted to uncover the unknown, even if it meant stepping on established norms or ignoring the risks involved. As a result, his talent was both admired and feared, but the institution was quickly growing tired of his disruptive behavior.\n\nOne night, he was caught sneaking into the restricted archives - again. No damage done, but it was a breach of protocol that couldn\u2019t be ignored. Officially, he was reprimanded and placed under strict oversight. Unofficially, it was made clear: one more misstep, and he\u2019d be out.\n\nHe left before they had the chance.\n\nIn his eyes, the Lyceum had become a cage - too slow, too cautious, too narrow in its thinking. He didn\u2019t need their approval to rise. If they wouldn\u2019t give him access to the knowledge he sought, he\u2019d find it himself.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s been traveling, following scattered references, cryptic symbols, forgotten journals. He\u2019s not after truth. He\u2019s after knowledge, insight, mastery. The kind that no one else has, because no one else is willing to reach for it the way he is.\n\nSaltmarsh is just the next step. A place on the edge of civilization, where rumors and relics go unnoticed. He doesn\u2019t care about the town. He cares about what secrets might be buried there.",
