They were part of a purging force that hunted her mother for forbidden surface-aligned and shadow magic. Mercy doesn’t know if they’re still alive… but she wants them to be.\nWhen she dreams, it’s of silver blades, laughter behind masks, and the moment her mother stopped moving.\n\nUnknown Father – A shadow her mother never named. Rumours swirl that he was surface-born, or a surface-trader. Mercy suspects he was powerful — maybe even responsible for what happened. She doesn’t know if she wants to find him or kill him… or both.\n\nSkerrin Wavechaser – The butler blocking Mercy’s attempts to reach Anders Solmor. He speaks too carefully and watches her too closely. She doesn’t trust men with veiled politeness.",
    "backstory": "Mercy was born Elarisse Zauvirr in the Underdark, the daughter of a low-ranking arcanist who practised forbidden shadow and surface-aligned magic. Her mother never spoke of Elarisse’s father — only that he was dangerous and not to be trusted. When the enforcers came, Elarisse was forced to watch her mother’s public execution, a spectacle designed to terrify. In the aftermath, someone smuggled her out of the city. She never saw them again.\n\nShe surfaced alone, and her name died with her mother. On the surface, people began to call her Mercy — not because she gave it, but because it’s what they whispered when they saw her coming. She was young when her powers flared violently in self-defence, leaving three men dead. From that point on, she ran, stole, and lashed out before anyone could hurt her. She worked odd jobs, fought when she had to, and made coin when she could as a hired blade with spellfire in her veins.\n\nMercy wants to be left alone. She wears a gaudy opal earring called The Widow’s Eye, stolen from a corpse, in open invitation to fools who think she looks like easy prey. Her only real companion was a dog she kept for over a decade — the only soul she ever truly loved. She doesn’t know who her father is — and if he’s still alive, she’s not sure if she wants to meet him or kill him.",

She weighs every word — most don’t get said.\n\nBlunt truth-teller – When she does speak, it’s usually to cut through the noise and say the thing no one else wants to — plainly, coldly, and with zero sugar.\n\nDark humour… at the worst times – Her sense of humour rarely surfaces. But in serious, tense, or even tragic moments, Mercy might suddenly cackle — the only one laughing in the room.\n\nKeeps people at a distance – Emotionally armoured. She doesn’t trust easily, and vulnerability makes her itch.\n\nGuilty pleasure: trashy romance novels – Passion, drama, betrayal — she hides them under her bedroll and reads them like sacred texts.\n\n“They say laughter is healing. Hers usually means someone’s bleeding.”",
    "ideals": "Survival Above All – Mercy does whatever it takes to stay alive. Loyalty is earned, not expected.\n\nFreedom from Control – No one owns her. Not nobles. Not gods. Not fate.\n\nSolitude Is Safety – Mercy doesn’t want power, riches, or glory. She just wants to be left alone. People lie, betray, or die — silence is better.\n\nPower Is Just Another Tool – Magic isn’t sacred or special — it’s something she uses when she needs to win, survive, or burn a threat to ash. She respects it, but she doesn’t worship it.",
    "bonds": "Herself – Mercy trusts no one but herself. She’s the only constant she’s ever had.\n\nHer (late) Dog – She once had a dog for over a decade — the only soul she ever truly loved. She would (and did) kill for it.\n\nThe Widow’s Eye – A singular, gaudy opal earring taken from a corpse. It’s her arcane focus, her dare to the world. She wears it to tempt fools into giving her a reason.\n\nThe One Who Helped Her Escape – Someone risked everything to help Mercy flee the Underdark after her mother’s execution. Whether they’re dead, lost, or forgotten, she carries the weight of that choice — and the debt of it.\n",
    "flaws": "Pushes people away before they can leave her\nShe’s been abandoned before — now she cuts ties before anyone gets the chance.\n\nAlways looking for a fight\nShe provokes conflict on purpose. If there’s tension in the air, she’ll press until it snaps — she wants the excuse to let loose.\n\nDoesn’t trust kindness\nIf someone’s nice to her, she assumes they want something. Mercy reads every kindness as manipulation.\n\nEmotionally shut down\nShe doesn’t process grief, guilt, or affection — she buries it deep and builds armour over the top.\n\nLaughs at the worst moments\nHer humour is a weapon — and sometimes, it cuts without warning. She’ll cackle at pain, horror, or death… and mean it.",

Mercy wears it in her right ear, always exposed. Mercy found it in a smuggler’s cove three years ago, hanging from the ear of a woman long-dead but untouched &mdash; no blood, no decay, just a slack body swaying from the rafters, lips curled in a strange half-smile.</p>\r\n<p>No name. No signs of struggle. A locked journal turned to mush by the salt air. Locals wouldn’t touch the body or the trinkets. They whispered of a curse. Said the woman had laughed before she climbed the rope.</p>\r\n<p>Mercy took the earring anyway. Not for profit. She didn’t even hesitate. She was half-starved and half-furious, on the run again, barely off a wrecked ship and still tasting smoke from the last time she lost control. When she saw the earring, it felt like it was already hers &mdash; like it had been waiting. She ripped it free and left the body swinging. Since then, she’s worn it every day. Not as a keepsake. As a challenge. Let it mark her. Let it gleam and tempt thieves and cutthroats. Let it draw attention so she has an excuse &mdash; to lash out, to fight, to bleed a little and burn off the ache in her chest she never talks about. When someone eyes it too long, she meets their stare like she wants them to try. People think she’s brave. Or reckless. Or cursed.</p>\r\n<p>But Mercy just needs an excuse</p>",
