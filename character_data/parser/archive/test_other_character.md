### Spell Details
#### Message
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Transmutation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 120 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p>
> <p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.</p>


<BR>

#### Minor Illusion
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Illusion
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 30 feet
> components: S
> duration: 1 minute
> ```
>
> <p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.</p>
> <p>If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Sound.</em></strong> If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Image.</em></strong> If you create an image of an object&mdash;such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest&mdash;it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.</p>


<BR>

#### Shocking Grasp
>
> ```badges
> items:

>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Touch
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Lightning damage, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Cantrip Upgrade.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).</p>


<BR>

#### Sorcerous Burst
>
> ```badges
> items:

>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 120 feet
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.</p>
> <p>If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell’s damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
> <p><em><strong>Cantrip Upgrade.</strong></em> The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).</p>


<BR>

#### Chromatic Orb
>
> ```badges
> items:

>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 90 feet
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage of the chosen type.</p>
> <p>If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can’t leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.</p>


<BR>

#### Command
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Touch
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:</p>
> <p><strong>Approach.</strong> The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.</p>
> <p><strong>Drop.</strong> The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.</p>
> <p><strong>Flee.</strong> The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.</p>
> <p><strong>Grovel.</strong> The target has the Prone condition and then ends its turn.</p>
> <p><strong>Halt.</strong> On its turn, the target doesn’t move and takes no action or Bonus Action.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.</p>


<BR>

#### False Life

> <p>You gain 2d4 + 4 Temporary Hit Points.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> You gain 5 additional Temporary Hit Points for each spell slot level above 1.</p>


<BR>

#### Shield
>

> ```
>
> ```spell-components

> duration: 1 round
> ```
>
> <p>An imperceptible barrier of magical force protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from Magic Missile.</p>


<BR>

#### Thunderwave
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self (15-foot cube)
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.</p>
> <p>In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.</p>


<BR>

#### Alter Self
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 2
>   - label: Transmutation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Aquatic Adaptation.</em></strong> You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Change Appearance.</em></strong> You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Natural Weapons.</em></strong> You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.</p>


<BR>

#### Blindness/Deafness
>
> ```badges

> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Blinded or Deafened condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.</p>


<BR>

#### Dragon's Breath

>
> ```spell-components

> range: Touch
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> <p>You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a Magic action to exhale a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>


<BR>

> <p>A creature you touch has the Invisible condition until the spell ends. The spell ends early immediately after the target makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell.</p>
> <p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.</p>

>### Spellcasting
>
> Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. *Cantrips.* You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table. *Spell Slots.* The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. *Prepared Spells of Level 1+.* You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you. *Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. *Spellcasting Ability.* Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells. *Spellcasting Focus.* You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

> You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest. You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points. *Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.* You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required). *Creating Spell Slots.* As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest. **Creating Spell Slots**

>
> *Class Feature (Level 2)*
>
> Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic Options” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.
