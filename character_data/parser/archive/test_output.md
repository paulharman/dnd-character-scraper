Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table.

For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
>
> If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

## Racial Traits

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Dark Elf (Drow) Traits
>
>#### Keen Senses
>
> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
>
>#### Fey Ancestry
>
> You have advantage on saving throws against being *charmed*, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
>
>#### Trance
>
> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Ability Score Increase
>
> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
>
>#### Languages
>
> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
>
>#### Age
>
> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
>
>#### Superior Darkvision
>
> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.
>
>#### Sunlight Sensitivity

When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
>

## Background

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
>### Urchin
>
> You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
>
> You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?
>
> Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
>
> Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, thieves’ tools
>
> Equipment: A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
>
> FEATURE: CITY SECRETS
>
> You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.
>
> Suggested Characteristics
>
> Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life — and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> Mercy was born Elarisse Zauvirr in the Underdark, the daughter of a low-ranking arcanist who practised forbidden shadow and surface-aligned magic. Her mother never spoke of Elarisse’s father — only that he was dangerous and not to be trusted. When the enforcers came, Elarisse was forced to watch her mother’s public execution, a spectacle designed to terrify. In the aftermath, someone smuggled her out of the city. She never saw them again.
>
> She surfaced alone, and her name died with her mother. On the surface, people began to call her Mercy — not because she gave it, but because it’s what they whispered when they saw her coming. She was young when her powers flared violently in self-defence, leaving three men dead. From that point on, she ran, stole, and lashed out before anyone could hurt her. She worked odd jobs, fought when she had to, and made coin when she could as a hired blade with spellfire in her veins.
>
> Mercy wants to be left alone. She wears a gaudy opal earring called The Widow’s Eye, stolen from a corpse, in open invitation to fools who think she looks like easy prey. Her only real companion was a dog she kept for over a decade — the only soul she ever truly loved. She doesn’t know who her father is — and if he’s still alive, she’s not sure if she wants to meet him or kill him.
