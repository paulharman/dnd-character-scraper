>
> *Cantrip Upgrade.* The damage increases by `1d10` when you reach levels 5 ( `2d10` ), 11 ( `3d10` ), and 17 ( `4d10` ).

>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components

> range: 10 feet
> components: S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You create a magical effect within range. Choose the effect from the options below. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time.
>
> *Sensory Effect.* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
>
> *Fire Play.* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
>
> *Clean or Soil.* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
>
> *Minor Sensation.* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
>
> *Magic Mark.* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
>
> *Minor Creation.* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand. It lasts until the end of your next turn. A trinket can deal no damage and has no monetary worth.


<BR>

#### True Strike
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Cantrip
>   - label: Divination
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> Guided by a flash of magical insight, you make one attack with the weapon used in the spell’s casting. The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be *Radiant damage* or the weapon’s normal damage type (your choice).
>
> *Cantrip Upgrade.* Whether you deal *Radiant damage* or the weapon’s normal damage type, the attack deals extra *Radiant damage* when you reach levels 5 ( `1d6` ), 11 ( `2d6` ), and 17 ( `3d6` ).


<BR>

#### Comprehend Languages

>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any language that you hear or see signed. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. This spell doesn’t decode symbols or secret messages.


<BR>

#### Detect Magic
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Divination
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: V, S
> duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
> ```
>
> For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell’s school of magic.
>
> The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.


<BR>

#### Disguise Self
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Illusion
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: Self
> components: S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> You make yourself&mdash;including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person&mdash;look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
>
> The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.
>
> To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.


<BR>

#### Find Familiar
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Conjuration
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Hour
> range: 10 feet
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: Bat, Cat, Frog, Hawk, Lizard, Octopus, Owl, Rat, Raven, Spider, Weasel, or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
>
> *Telepathic Connection.* While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
>
> Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.
>
> *Combat.* The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
>
> *Disappearance of the Familiar.* When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
>
> *One Familiar Only.* You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.


<BR>

#### Identify
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Divination
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Minute
> range: Touch
> components: V, S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You touch an object throughout the spell’s casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires Attunement, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell’s name.
>
> If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it.


<BR>

#### Magic Missile
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Evocation
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 120 feet
> components: S
> duration: Instantaneous
> ```
>
> You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals `1d4 + 1` *Force damage* to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
>
> *Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.* The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.


<BR>

#### Shield
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Abjuration
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Reaction
> range: Self
> components: V, S
> duration: 1 round
> ```
>
> An imperceptible barrier of magical force protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from Magic Missile.


<BR>

#### Sleep
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Enchantment
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 90 feet
> components: S
> duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
> ```
>
> Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the *Incapacitated* condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the *Unconscious* condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect.
>
> Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the *Exhaustion* condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.


<BR>

#### Unseen Servant
>
> ```badges
> items:
>   - label: Level 1
>   - label: Conjuration
>   - label:
>   - label: F
> ```
>
> ```spell-components
> casting_time: 1 Action
> range: 60 feet
> components: S
> duration: 1 hour
> ```
>
> This spell creates an *Invisible*, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.
>
> Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
>
> If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

>### Spellcasting
>
> As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells.
>
> *Cantrips.* You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.
>
> When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.
>
> *Spellbook.* Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
>
> The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.
>
> Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.
>
> *Spell Slots.* The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
>
> *Prepared Spells of Level 1+.* You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
>
> The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.
>
> If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.
>
> *Changing Your Prepared Spells.* Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.
>
> *Spellcasting Ability.* Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.
>
> *Spellcasting Focus.* You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.
>
> Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook
>
> The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.
>
> *Copying a Spell into the Book.* When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.
>
> *Copying the Book.* You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.
>

>### Ritual Adept
>
> You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.
>

>### Arcane Recovery
>
> ```consumable
> label: ""
> state_key: ilarion_veles_paul_arcane_recovery
> uses: 1
> ```
>
> You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.
>
> Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
>

>### Scholar
>
> *Class Feature (Level 2)*
>
> While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.

## Backstory

<span class="right-link">[[#Character Statistics|Top]]</span>
> From a young age, Ilarion was always a step ahead. Born into a lesser noble house in the city of Elarith, he grew up in a world where knowledge meant status. But where others saw learning as tradition, he saw it as conquest. From the start, he wasn't satisfied with understanding what was known - he was driven to uncover what was not.
>
> At the Arcanum Lyceum, Ilarion quickly made a name for himself, not just for his exceptional intellect, but for his relentless pursuit of knowledge at any cost. His brilliance was undeniable, though it often came paired with an arrogance that grated on his peers and instructors alike. He wasn’t content to simply learn what was presented to him - he questioned everything, disregarded traditional methods, and constantly pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable study.
>
> Ilarion often ignored the advice of his professors, seeking answers to questions that had yet to be posed in the curriculum. He’d sneak into the restricted archives, eager to dig through forbidden texts, and propose his own untested theories during lectures, frustrating those around him. He wasn’t interested in what others thought was practical or safe; he wanted to uncover the unknown, even if it meant stepping on established norms or ignoring the risks involved. As a result, his talent was both admired and feared, but the institution was quickly growing tired of his disruptive behavior.
>
> One night, he was caught sneaking into the restricted archives - again. No damage done, but it was a breach of protocol that couldn’t be ignored. Officially, he was reprimanded and placed under strict oversight. Unofficially, it was made clear: one more misstep, and he’d be out.
>
> He left before they had the chance.
>
> In his eyes, the Lyceum had become a cage - too slow, too cautious, too narrow in its thinking. He didn’t need their approval to rise. If they wouldn’t give him access to the knowledge he sought, he’d find it himself.
>
> Since then, he’s been traveling, following scattered references, cryptic symbols, forgotten journals. He’s not after truth. He’s after knowledge, insight, mastery. The kind that no one else has, because no one else is willing to reach for it the way he is.
>
> Saltmarsh is just the next step. A place on the edge of civilization, where rumors and relics go unnoticed. He doesn’t care about the town. He cares about what secrets might be buried there.
