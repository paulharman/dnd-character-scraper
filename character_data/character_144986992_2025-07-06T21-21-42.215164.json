Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own&mdash;it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time?

One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).</p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart&mdash;in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>",

    "allies": " Eryndor Veylin (Old Tutor)\n— A stern but kind-hearted elven mage who taught her the basics of control before her power truly awakened.\n— The only person from her old life she still has any fondness for — though she’d never admit it.",
    "backstory": "Born into the ancient and unyielding House Duskthorn, Vaelith grew up wrapped in silks, duty, and suffocating expectation. Her family prized status and image above all else, molding her into the perfect noble daughter — obedient, elegant, and silent. But fate had other plans.\n\nWhen her innate sorcerous power first sparked, it was seen as an asset, a rare gift to parade at court — until the day she uncovered a betrayal so deep it shattered the world she knew. A nobleman she once trusted, a man who had charmed his way past her walls, wronged her in the worst way, only to twist the truth before her family could ever hold him accountable. His lies were silver-tongued, his reputation untouchable — and House Duskthorn, ever loyal to their image above all, branded her a liar.\n\nThe wound cut deeper than any blade. Cast out by the only people who should have stood at her side, Vaelith left with nothing but a handful of stolen coin, her sharpened will, her growing command over lightning, and an iron vow to carve her own name into history — on her terms, not theirs.\n\nThe last of her gold bought her a place aboard a nameless ship, its sails fat with wind and bound for the forgotten edges of the world. For now, she needs coin to survive. But her true hunger is for power — enough to command the respect her family denied her, enough to make the world swallow every bitter word they ever dared speak against her.\n\nShe walks the world with a storm behind her eyes and a resting expression cold enough to kill. Her nails — long, sharp, and meticulously painted black — are as much a weapon as her magic, and she wears them like a queen wears a crown: a quiet, permanent reminder that she doesn’t need steel to draw blood.\n\nTo the world, she is cold, calculating, and unapproachable. But beneath the sharp edges lies a heart that still burns — for freedom, for justice, and for the protection of those few souls worthy of her trust.\n\nWrong her, and you’ll regret it. Betray her, and you’ll wish she’d chosen lightning. And should the man who shattered her life cross her path again… death would be too kind a fate.",
