# Obsidian Integration Files

This directory contains files for integrating D&D character data with Obsidian:

## 📁 Contents

- **`InventoryManager.jsx`** - DataCore JSX component for interactive inventory management
- **`SpellGenerator.jsx`** - DataCore JSX component for spell management  
- **`Spell Hub.md`** - Obsidian hub page for spell management

## 🔧 Usage

These files are designed to work with Obsidian and the DataCore plugin:

```jsx
// In an Obsidian note
```datacorejsx
const { InventoryQuery } = await dc.require("z_Templates/InventoryManager.jsx");
return <InventoryQuery characterName="Character Name" />;
```

## 🎯 Integration

These components work with character markdown files generated by the parser to provide:
- Interactive inventory filtering and searching
- Spell management and organization
- Rich data visualization within Obsidian

Place these files in your Obsidian vault's template directory (e.g., `z_Templates/`) for easy access.
