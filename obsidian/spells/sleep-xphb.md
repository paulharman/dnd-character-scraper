# Sleep
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Incapacitated](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [Unconscious](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have [Immunity](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Exhaustion](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Exhaustion) condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.
