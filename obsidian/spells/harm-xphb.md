# Harm
*6th-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `14d6` Necrotic damage, and its [Hit Point](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can't reduce a target's [Hit Point](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum below 1.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
