# Entangle
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](/z_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/entangle.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [Difficult Terrain](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md). They disappear when the spell ends.

Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [Restrained](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the spell ends. A [Restrained](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](/z_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer [Restrained](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) by them.

**Classes**: [Druid](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
