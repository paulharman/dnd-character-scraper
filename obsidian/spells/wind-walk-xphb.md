# Wind Walk
*6th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a candle)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a [Fly Speed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 300 feet and can hover; it has [Immunity](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Prone](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition; and it has [Resistance](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [Dash](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dash) action or a [Magic](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [Stunned](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [Magic](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action followed by a 1-minute transformation.

If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.

**Classes**: [Druid](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
