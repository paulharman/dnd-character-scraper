# Weird
*9th-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `10d10` Psychic damage and has the [Frightened](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A [Frightened](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes `5d10` Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
