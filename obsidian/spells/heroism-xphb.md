# Heroism
*1st-level, Enchantment*

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to the [Frightened](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) condition and gains [Temporary Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
