# Hail of Thorns
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `1d10` Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
