# Storm of Vengeance
*9th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 1 miles
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A churning storm cloud forms for the duration, centered on a point within range and spreading to a radius of 300 feet. Each creature under the cloud when it appears must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `2d6` Thunder damage and have the [Deafened](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened) condition for the duration.

At the start of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed below.

## Turn 2

Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud takes `4d6` Acid damage.

## Turn 3

You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Turn 4

Hailstones rain down. Each creature under the cloud takes `2d6` Bludgeoning damage.

## Turns 5-10

Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes `1d6` Cold damage. Until the spell ends, the area is [Difficult Terrain](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) and [Heavily Obscured](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md), ranged attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the area.

## Summary

**Classes**: [Druid](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
