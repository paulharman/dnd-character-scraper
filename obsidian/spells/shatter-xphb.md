# Shatter
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `3d8` Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has [Disadvantage](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Druid (Circle of the Sea)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-sea-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
