# Slow
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's [Speed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a [Bonus Action](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [Attack](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Attack) action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a  chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.
