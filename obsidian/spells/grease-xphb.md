# Grease
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into [Difficult Terrain](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall [Prone](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone).

**Classes**: [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
