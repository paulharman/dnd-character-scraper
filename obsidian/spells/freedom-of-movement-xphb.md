# Freedom of Movement
*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [Speed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions. The target also has a [Swim Speed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to its [Speed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Grappled) condition on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
