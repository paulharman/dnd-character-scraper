# Sequester
*7th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the [Invisible](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.

If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the [Unconscious](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

**Classes**: [Wizard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
