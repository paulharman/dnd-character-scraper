# Conjure Woodland Beings
*4th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes `5d8` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the [Disengage](/z_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Disengage) action as a [Bonus Action](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) for the spell's duration.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Druid](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
