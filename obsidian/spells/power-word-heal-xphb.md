# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [Hit Points](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the creature has the [Charmed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), [Frightened](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened), [Paralyzed](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [Poisoned](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned), or [Stunned](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [Prone](/z_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition, it can use its [Reaction](/z_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to stand up.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
