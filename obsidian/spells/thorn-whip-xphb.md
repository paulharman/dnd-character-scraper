# Thorn Whip
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the stem of a plant with thorns)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d6` Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you can pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).

**Classes**: [Druid](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/z_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
