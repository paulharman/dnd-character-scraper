Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands. **Telepathic Connection.** While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell. **Combat.** The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. **Disappearance of the Familiar.** When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying. **One Familiar Only.** You can’t have more than one familiar at a time.

    "backstory": "From a young age, Ilarion was always a step ahead. Born into a lesser noble house in the city of Elarith, he grew up in a world where knowledge meant status. But where others saw learning as tradition, he saw it as conquest. From the start, he wasn't satisfied with understanding what was known - he was driven to uncover what was not.\n\nAt the Arcanum Lyceum, Ilarion quickly made a name for himself, not just for his exceptional intellect, but for his relentless pursuit of knowledge at any cost. His brilliance was undeniable, though it often came paired with an arrogance that grated on his peers and instructors alike. He wasn’t content to simply learn what was presented to him - he questioned everything, disregarded traditional methods, and constantly pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable study.\n\nIlarion often ignored the advice of his professors, seeking answers to questions that had yet to be posed in the curriculum. He’d sneak into the restricted archives, eager to dig through forbidden texts, and propose his own untested theories during lectures, frustrating those around him. He wasn’t interested in what others thought was practical or safe; he wanted to uncover the unknown, even if it meant stepping on established norms or ignoring the risks involved. As a result, his talent was both admired and feared, but the institution was quickly growing tired of his disruptive behavior.\n\nOne night, he was caught sneaking into the restricted archives - again. No damage done, but it was a breach of protocol that couldn’t be ignored. Officially, he was reprimanded and placed under strict oversight. Unofficially, it was made clear: one more misstep, and he’d be out.\n\nHe left before they had the chance.\n\nIn his eyes, the Lyceum had become a cage - too slow, too cautious, too narrow in its thinking. He didn’t need their approval to rise. If they wouldn’t give him access to the knowledge he sought, he’d find it himself.\n\nSince then, he’s been traveling, following scattered references, cryptic symbols, forgotten journals. He’s not after truth. He’s after knowledge, insight, mastery. The kind that no one else has, because no one else is willing to reach for it the way he is.\n\nSaltmarsh is just the next step. A place on the edge of civilization, where rumors and relics go unnoticed. He doesn’t care about the town. He cares about what secrets might be buried there.",
