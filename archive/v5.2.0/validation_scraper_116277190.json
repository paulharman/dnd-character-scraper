    "description": "You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for. **Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Religion **Tool Proficiencies:** Herbalism kit **Languages:** One of your choice **Equipment:** A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, an herbalism kit, and 5 gp Life of Seclusion What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion. d8 Life of Seclusion 1 I was searching for spiritual enlightenment. 2 I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order. 3 I was exiled for a crime I didn’t commit. 4 I retreated from society after a life-altering event. 5 I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto. 6 I needed to commune with nature, far from civilization. 7 I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic. 8 I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance. Feature: Discovery The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign. Other Hermits This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.",

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits: • You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws. • You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes. • When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal. • The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force. • Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make one extra attack with your astral arms as a bonus action. The number of extra attacks increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two at 11th level and three at 17th level.",
