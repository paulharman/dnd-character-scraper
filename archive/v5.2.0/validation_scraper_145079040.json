His father, a major figure in the mountains armies, trained a young Thuldus in warfare and the ways of the barbarian.\n\nIn his teen years he rose through the ranks and claimed many victory's and in many cases been key to turning the tide in pivotal battles.\n\nAs dedicated as he was to serving the mountain and it's defences Thuldus was as susceptible to love and desire as anyone else, especially when it came to a young barmaid named Ellie Halfmountain.\n\nAs young love blossomed, duty began to be neglected and resentment from his father towards Ellie arose. The day came where Thuldus and Ellie expressed desire to be wed and for Thuldus to retire from warfare only to be denied this by his father being told 'to neglect your duties for love is to betray the mountain and it's people' and 'if you carry on down this path you shall be disowned and Stripped of all titles.'\n\nWith rage and resentment in his heart Thuldus made the difficult decision to leave the safety of the mountain in search of a peaceful life and begin a family.\n\n2 years on they young couple had achieved their dream. In the shadow of a neighbouring mountain amongst a small forest the couple had built a home and had a child. A cute baby girl that looked like her mother but had her fathers fiery red hair. Finally the couple were happy and at peace. Until an Orc raiding party on its way to a dwarven village passed through the forest. \n\nBelieving his family to be safe and that no harm could befall them in the safety of the forest Thuldus had ventured out on a hunt as he would do weekly. The smell had reached him before the sight.. fire.. the forest was ablaze. He rushed back through smoke and flames to the opening In the trees where the couples log cabin once stood to find it smouldering and caved in and on the ground in front of the ruins lay a lonely figure. Thuldus roared into the sky holding the lifeless body of his beloved Ellie, his baby daughter was nowhere to be found.\n\nHe spent the next 5 years in vain searching for any sign on the orc troop that marched through the forest that day. With no leads and no witnesses desire for revenge gave way to despair and as time past Thuldus turned to drink as his only comfort.\n\n15 years on Thuldus now spends his time as a mercenary of sorts to fund his drinking habits. A quiet rage over his lost life still simmers behind his eyes but the desire for revenge is all but gone.\n\n",
