    "appearance_description": "Redgrave confidently stood tall above most creatures, but that isn't the first thing most people noticed about it. \n\nThe first thing they noticed was its metallic skin, woven with a mixture of wood and flesh. Its eyes, literal gemstones set securely in their sockets. Its metallic form was engraved finely with gold inlay, work of a true master craftsman. \n\nIts body was lined with interlocking plates of metal, coming together to shield it like a fine suit of armor. Around its shoulders a cloak was wrapped, made of crimson threads with cerulean and gold stitching. The brooch bore the all seeing eye of Helm, god of protection. \n\nUnderneath the cloak it wore a saffron tabard, with a crimson streak through it. At its waist was a belt of various smith's tools, and a large arcane tome.\n\nYears ago Redgrave used to try and conceal its appearance under extra layers of armor and a helmet. Now it cares not so much for the suspicions of mortal men. While many look at it with confusion, disgust, or even fear; it would never blame them.\n\nOn the other hand, news of its exploits and craftsmanship have earned it a bit of a reputation. Many townsfolk have taken to calling it the Clockwork Cleric. A name that would make it roll its eyes if it could actually do such a thing. \n",

Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war.</p>\r\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family: Roboto Condensed;\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />+1&nbsp;Constitution, Warforged Resilience, Sentry's Rest, Integrated Protection</p><p>As an envoy, you were designed with a certain specialized function in mind. You might be an assassin, a healer, or an entertainer, to name a few possibilities. Envoys are the rarest of the warforged subraces, and yours could be a unique design.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>ENVOYS: SPECIALIZED DESIGN</strong></p>\r\n<p>As the name implies, most warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The vast majority of warforged are juggernauts or skirmishers &mdash; soldiers and scouts who fought under the banner of one of the Five Nations. Warforged envoys, however, were designed to perform other functions. As an envoy you have a skill, a tool proficiency, and a tool that&rsquo;s part of your body. When you make an envoy character, consider the following questions: what is your purpose? How does your skill and tool reflect that purpose? What form does your integrated tool take? If you have embedded thieves&rsquo; tools, for instance, are your fingers actually lockpicks, or can you produce keys from various parts of your body? The following characters are examples of warforged with integrated tools.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lute</strong> is a bard with the entertainer background; his namesake instrument folds out of his left arm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Compass Rose</strong> is a wizard with the outlander background. A keen explorer, she uses her built-in cartographer&rsquo;s tools to records the paths she travels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Masque</strong> is an infiltrator. A rogue with the charlatan background and an integrated disguise kit, she was built to blend in and assassinate. Cannith built six warforged of her design, and Masque has vowed to hunt down and destroy the other five.</p>\r\n<p>In developing your integrated tool, remember that you must have your hands free to use it. Masque, the infiltrator mentioned above, doesn&rsquo;t shapeshift like a changeling; she has to manually adjust her appearance.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.</p>\r\n<p>Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.</p>\r\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Merchant</h5>\r\n<p>Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.</p>",

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

    "backstory": "Forged in lightning and blood by the dark wizard Eludrax, \"Eight\" was born. The wizard's thirst for eternal life led him not to the cultivation of a new fleshy body, but a perfect one of his own design.\nUsing ancient techniques from lands quite distant, Eludrax forged machines for his allies war efforts. Nothing, however, could keep him from his true life's work.\n\n---\n\nIt was the eighth of Eludrax's shield guardians, and thus aptly named. \n\nMost of of the Lich's constructs bore no soul of their own, merely mindless automatons for his own bidding. He would often pluck lost souls from Limbo and twist and torture them to suit his machinations. \n\nBut the eight were different. They were his personal bodyguards, improved physically in every way, and candidates for his transference of life. Most importantly, they were devoid of soul.\n\nAt the aging dark wizard's command the constructs committed unspeakable atrocities. They were the harbingers of his dirty work, and Eludrax was not above committing horrors in the name of his research.\n\nEight was his magnum opus, and thus his intended vessel. His plan to transfer his own soul into the guardian was made haste, however, as Eludrax awoke one night to an adventurer's group tearing through his laboratory. He commanded Eight to follow, sending the other seven to combat the coming threat. \n\nHe clamored as fast as he could to the dark crystal machine intended to bind his soul into his vessel,  and spilled his blood on the dais with a quick slice to the palm. He grasped Eight's cool metal hand, and forced it onto the crystal. Thus, the dark ritual began. Eludrax's eyes went white as his spirit was ripped from his body and absorbed into the orb. \n\nWhat he miscalculated, however, was that a soul already existed inside his creation. It was faint, beaten down by years of cruelty and transgression, but there nonetheless.\n\nThe Lich's powerful spirit growled menacingly as it reached out to pluck the soul from Eight. Before he could, however, a burst of radiance appeared to encapsulate the soul. Eludrax's fury burned hot, but was not strong enough to pierce the veil of light. \n\nTime was not on the dark wizard's side. The party that'd breached his laboratory had finally made it into this sanctum. The group exchanged quick words, deliberating on their plan of action. Before their sorcerer could cry out, however, the paladin raised her mace and brought it crashing down on the large swirling crystal. As it shattered, the wizard's soul was cast into limbo, spiraling out of the material plane with a guttural scream.\n\n\"Am I...?\" Eight spoke aloud with a sound of relief, before collapsing to the cold stone floor with a hearty thud. \n\n---\n\nEight awoke to the stench of burning and the feel of a warm hand against its cold metal chest. In the distance the tower it'd known as its home, the place of its creation, was fervently ablaze.\n\n\"Can it understand us?\" One of the adventurers pondered out loud. \nEight nodded in response \n\nThe woman whose hand was pulsating over it with life magic leaned in a bit closer to its face.\n\"So, do you have a name?\" She asked in a soft voice, curiously, as if she were talking to a child.\n\nEight looked down at the ground, then back at the burning spire behind him. \n\n\"Redgrave,\" it muttered quietly, then returned its gaze to hers. \n\n\"My name is Redgrave.\"\n\n\"Like that tower?\" One of the men in the group asked questioningly. \n\n\"Yes,\" the forged known formerly as Eight responded.\n\"So that I may never forget what happened here.\" \n",
